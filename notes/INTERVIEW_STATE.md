## Active question

**CORE-35 — What does focus targeting do?**

*Consider: Information, cast tracking, marks, homing skills, controller assistance, or nothing.
It should not silently replace free aiming unless intended.*

No answer has been accepted yet. Relevant constraints from earlier answers:

- CORE-31 [L]: combat never requires a selected or locked target; any focus-target feature
  must remain optional and subordinate to free aiming, and can never be a prerequisite for
  any combat action. Its exact functions were explicitly deferred to CORE-35.
- CORE-33/34 doubled down on movement purity and one item-granted active; "focus targeting
  does nothing / is cut" is a fully legitimate answer.
- Controller may use a twin-stick equivalent (CORE-31); focus targeting as controller
  assistance is one possible bounded role.

## Question status table

| Range | State |
|---|---|
| CORE-01 through CORE-16 | Answered. CORE-14 remains provisional/test-gated. |
| CORE-17 | Open. Frame as **first character's journey to endgame**, not "campaign". No numerical duration locked. |
| CORE-18 | Open. Constrained by CORE-24's locked endgame direction. |
| CORE-19, CORE-20 | Open, unanswered. |
| CORE-21 through CORE-34 | Approved and integrated into the GDD. |
| **CORE-35** | **ACTIVE — no accepted answer.** |
| CORE-36 onward | Unanswered. |

The designer chose to continue past CORE-34 while CORE-17 through CORE-20 remain open.
Continue at CORE-35 unless the designer chooses to return to an earlier open question.

### CORE-34 — answered 2026-07-26 [L/P]

Exactly one active ability per character, granted by an equipped ability item; each class
has its own large pool of ability-equips, so ability variety and build identity come from
the loot hunt (weapon = primary pattern, ability item = active, armor = stats). Abilities
run on mana; the item defines behaviour and cost. The skill tree grants no actives — it is
passives/resource/specialization with a binding condition that meaningful nodes change
behaviour, not just numbers (including modifying equipped ability items). Max-level
capstone that supercharges the equipped item = open design space [P]. No mandated role
checklist. No encounter may require a specific ability item, or any ability, to be
survivable — movement stays sufficient (designer: "awesome boss fights where movement is
enough, just like RotMG").

### CORE-33 — answered 2026-07-26 [L/P]

Purely movement-based dodging, RotMG tradition. Universal kit = movement + free aim only;
no universal dash, roll, blink, sprint, block, parry, shield, or i-frame action. Binding
consequences recorded: honest dodgeability by movement alone (at the least mobile class's
baseline), movement speed as a premier tuned stat, readability/traceable deaths even more
load-bearing, death design must account for no escape action. Class-specific mobility or
defensive abilities may exist as class tools [P]; never required by encounters; roles and
counts belong to CORE-34.

### Refinement batch — 2026-07-26 (approved, recorded, committed)

Out-of-order refinements approved after a coherence review; integrated into the GDD,
Decision Register, and Living Questionnaire:

1. **Dry-streak mitigation [P]** (CORE-16): no pity ever; reward breadth instead —
   cosmetic/collection drops from bosses, recorded straight into the collection menu.
2. **Controller worst case [P]** (CORE-13/12): controller may end up as the relaxed
   grinding input only; endgame expects M+K; Steam Deck demoted to "where it survives".
3. **Variation bounds [P]** (CORE-27): authored *where*, pooled *what* — fixed arenas
   with 3–4 possible bosses; roaming rares patrol authored zone+route; pooled locations
   share key rewards or stay variety-only.
4. **Pets cosmetic-only [P]** (CORE-25): no combat/stat benefit of any kind, if included.
5. **Raid structure [P/T]** (CORE-16 raid scope): wings as the unit of commitment;
   player-controlled persistence, no time-based lockouts, free instant reset;
   deterministic skip baseline (mastery shortcuts or trophy tokens) [T]; rare skips
   only as luxury on top; within-wing checkpoints test-gated.

## Note-taking protocol (the fix for lost notes)

After **each** approved answer, in the same working session, before moving to the next question:

1. Record the approved decision with its status tag ([L]/[P]/[T]/[U]/[CUT]/[LATER]) in
   `docs/10-LIVING_DESIGN_QUESTIONNAIRE.md` (fill the question's answer slot).
2. Update `docs/08-DECISION_REGISTER.md` with the concise decision entry.
3. Integrate the decision into `docs/01-GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` where it belongs.
4. Update the **Active question** and **status table** in this file to the next question.
5. Append a short entry to today's file in `notes/sessions/`.
6. `git commit` all of the above and push. **One approved answer = one commit.**

Never batch multiple answered questions into a deferred "I'll write it up later" step —
that is exactly how notes were lost before this repo existed.

## Working method (established, unchanged)

- Ask one focused question at a time and finish it before moving on.
- Consolidate the designer's natural answer into clear design language; get approval before recording.
- Keep straightforward decisions concise; expand when a decision has real design, balance, technical, or production consequences.
- Use existing answers before asking for a decision again.
- Challenge material design or production risks honestly.
- Treat purposeful, targetable repetition as an intended strength.
